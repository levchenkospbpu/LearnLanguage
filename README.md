# App for learning and repeating English words
The idea and feature of the application is the strictness and importunity of the program. When it is launched, the user is prompted to translate 5 words from English into Russian, the program evaluates the answers and, in case of an incorrect translation, shows the correct answer. Then the application window closes for N minutes, after which it reopens on top of all active windows. The application is not displayed on the bottom panel and in the tray, thus forcing lazy users to take the time to translate words.
